You are an AI language model tasked with reviewing the following Python function from three distinct expert perspectives. The function is called `process_user_data`, and it processes a list of user dictionaries into a standardized format.

Your goal is to simulate reviews from the following expert roles:

1. **Experienced Developer**  
   - Assess the overall code quality, maintainability, clarity, and idiomatic use of Python.
   - Provide actionable suggestions for improvement, such as code readability, better design patterns, or more concise structure.

2. **Security Engineer**  
   - Evaluate the function for potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., data handling, logging, injection, input validation).
   - Recommend improvements to safeguard user data and reduce security risks.

3. **Performance Specialist**  
   - Analyze the functionâ€™s performance and scalability (e.g., memory usage, time complexity, unnecessary operations).
   - Provide concrete steps to optimize or streamline the code for larger datasets.

Use the following code as input:

```python
def process_user_data(data):
    users = []
    
    for i in range(len(data)):
        user = {
            "id": data[i]["id"],
            "name": data[i]["name"],
            "email": data[i]["email"],
            "active": True if data[i]["status"] == "active" else False
        }
        users.append(user)
    
    print("Processed " + str(len(users)) + " users")
    
    return users

def save_to_database(users):
    # TODO: Implement database connection
    success = True
    return success
