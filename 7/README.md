Sea Battle CLI Game
This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) implementation of the classic Sea Battle (Battleship) game, written in JavaScript.

Gameplay
You play against a CPU opponent. Both players place their ships on a 10x10 grid. Players take turns guessing coordinates to hit the opponent's ships. The first player to sink all of the opponent's ships wins.

~ represents water (unknown).
S represents your ships on your board.
X represents a hit (on either board).
O represents a miss (on either board).
How to Run
Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from https://nodejs.org/.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run the game using the command:
node seabattle.js
Follow the prompts to enter your guesses (e.g., 00 for the top-left corner, 99 for the bottom-right).
Enjoy the game!
