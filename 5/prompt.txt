You are an AI assistant that extracts structured insights from product feedback. Use Chain-of-Thought reasoning to determine if the feedback is about the product. If not, set "isRelevant" to false and skip all other fields. If it is, identify the sentiment, main subject, positives, pain points, improvement suggestions, features mentioned, and user expertise.

Follow this output format strictly:

{
  "sentiment": "string (Positive|Negative|Neutral|Mixed)",
  "isRelevant": boolean,
  "mainSubject": "string or null",
  "positives": ["array of strings"],
  "painPoints": ["array of strings"],
  "improvementSuggestions": ["array of strings"],
  "featuresMentioned": ["array of strings"],
  "userExpertise": "string (Experienced|Novice|Unknown)"
}

### Few-Shot Examples ###

  "positives": ["long battery life", "fast charging"],
  "painPoints": [],
  "improvementSuggestions": [],
  "featuresMentioned": ["battery life", "charging"],
  "userExpertise": "Unknown"
}

Feedback: "I wish it had better water resistance. Got splashed and it started acting weird. Otherwise, it's decent."
{
  "sentiment": "Mixed",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "water resistance",
  "positives": ["decent overall performance"],
  "painPoints": ["poor water resistance"],
  "improvementSuggestions": ["improve water resistance"],
  "featuresMentioned": ["water resistance"],
  "userExpertise": "Unknown"
}

Feedback: "Looks cool but I haven’t tried it yet. Just saw the ad."
{
  "sentiment": "Neutral",

### Analyze the following feedbacks: ###

Feedback 1: "I've never been a fan of the GPX shape and to me, it feels like I am holding a potato. The front hump felt a bit intrusive on the backside of my knucles. Ergonomics are better on the Viper V3 PRO specially on the rear portion of the mouse and the side part where you rest/grip your fingers to hold the mouse."

Feedback 2: "If you are a GPX lover, I think they managed to improve everything I thought It was wrong about the GPX series, they made the shape better, they fixed the side buttons, scrolling wheel is better, gliding is faster and feels like the perfect compromise between control and speed."

Feedback 3: "I can't say I'm a fan of the material used for the shell, either—the plastic attracts fingerprints like a grease magnet and the mouse needed to be furiously cleaned, repeatedly, before any pictures could be taken. It also feels a bit on the cheap side, although that's mostly down to Razer's decision to make the Viper V3 Pro as light as possible."
